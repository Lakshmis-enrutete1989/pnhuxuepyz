Omg just came out of seeing Henry Danger: The Movie and I think half my brain is still stuck in the theater with the broken armrest and the sticky floors. The kids in the row behind me were like a band of hyenas, scream-laughing everytime Jasper did something ridiculous which, let's admit it, was every 5 minutes.

The opening scene??? Pure chaos, like if a blender was set to max speed without a lid. Bright colors, Captain Man being — well, Captain Man, doing this ridiculously over-the-top heroic intro and I nearly choked on my popcorn. Why do they make those buckets so large? It’s like they expect you to settle in for a week-long binge and not a two-hour  .

And Charlotte! So fierce! Running around with those gadgets like a techie James Bond but for kids, where no one ever seems to have homework or parental supervision. How does that work? Ah, the paradox of kid superhero logic.

> Somewhere in the middle of Kid Danger's wild side quest, trying to save the world and worrying about a zit (real teen priorities), it kind of hit me like when you realize you've worn mismatched socks all day. Like, this   is the pizza toppings of action comedies — a bizarre mix but somehow it works. 

Plus that scene...Oh! That scene where Schwoz built something out-of-this-world crazy. It was like if Einstein and Willy Wonka decided to have a tech baby. My brain still can't wrap around it, but that's probably cause I was distracted trying to fish popcorn crumbs out of my sweater pocket.

Yknow how someone asked if they could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘪𝘯𝘦, I mean you'd totally get the same vibe at home. Just add a bunch of ferrets to recreate the crowd experience.

And the noise? Jeez, my back's aching like I sat on a stool made of jello throughout it all. But it's all worth it to see Henry and the gang save Swellview again. Or save something, I'm not even totally sure cause my mind drifted to that time we tried to parallel park my dad's old Honda, and it was equally perilous.

Anyway, summarize all the scattered pieces like so, and it's compelling, confounding, and oddly comforting all at once, like hugging a porcupine. You'll laugh, you'll gasp, as predictable as rain at a picnic but infinitely more colorful.
